    <synopsis length="long">
The risk of an eruption at Iceland's Bardarbunga volcano has increased, after a series of earthquakes in the region.

The risk level to the aviation industry has been raised to orange, the second-highest level.

The eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano in 2010 shut down much of Europe's airspace for six days, affecting more than 10 million people.
