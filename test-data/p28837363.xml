    <synopsis length="long">
A joke by comedian Tim Vine about a vacuum cleaner has been voted the funniest at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

He won with the one-liner: "I decided to sell my Hoover... well it was just collecting dust."

Vine, 47, saw his joke scoop almost a fifth of the votes in the competition run by comedy TV channel, Dave.

Tim spoke to the BBC about winning the award and how he writes his jokes.</synopsis>
