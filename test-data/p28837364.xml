War Horse has been seen by nearly six million people in theatres around the world but now it is about to take its biggest jump yet - into China.

Although the show will not open for another 13 months, rehearsals are already underway.

The stage play is based on the children's novel by Michael Morpurgo. It tells the story of a horse, Joey, purchased by the army for service in World War One.

The BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie reports from Beijing.</synopsis>
